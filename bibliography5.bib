  abstract = {La 4ème de couverture indique : "Networks are everywhere, from the Internet, to social networks, and the genetic networks that determine our biological existence. Illustrated throughout in full colour, this pioneering textbook, spanning a wide range of topics from physics to computer science, engineering, economics and the social sciences, introduces network science to an interdisciplinary audience. From the origins of the six degrees of separation to explaining why networks are robust to random failures, the author explores how viruses like Ebola and H1N1 spread, and why it is that our friends have more friends than we do. Using numerous real-world examples, this innovatively designed text includes clear delineation between undergraduate and graduate level material"},

@article{Reinert2001,
	abstract = {Abstract Small world models are networks consisting of many local links and fewer long range `shortcuts'. In this paper, we consider some particular instances, and rigorously investigate the distribution of their inter-point network distances. Our results are framed in terms of approximations, whose accuracy increases with the size of the network. We also give some insight into how the reduction in typical inter-point distances occasioned by the presence of shortcuts is related to the dimension of the underlying space. {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Random Struct.
