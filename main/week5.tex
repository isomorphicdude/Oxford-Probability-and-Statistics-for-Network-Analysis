\section{Threshold Behaviours} 

\subsection{Motivating Example}

In $G(n,p)$, if $p=\frac{c}{n}$ with $c<1$, then the largest connected component is of size $O(\log n)$, whereas if $c>1$, then the largest connected component is of linear size with probability $1$ as $n\to \infty$.  

\subsection{A Simple Approach}
We use the approach in \citep{krivelevich2012phase} and use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm on the random graph. 

\subsubsection{Depth-First Search}
The DFS operates on the vertex set $V$ with three sets of vertices at each step:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ is the set that has been explored
    \item $T$ is the set of vertices to be explored
    \item $U = V\setminus (S\cup T)$ is the set of vertices under investigation
\end{itemize}

The algorithm starts with $S=\emptyset$, $T=V$ and $U=\emptyset$. At each step, if $U$ is nonempty, let $v$ be the last vertex added to $U$, we perform the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $v$ has a neighbour $u$ in $S$, move $u$ from $T$ to $U$.
    \item If $v$ has no neighbour in $S$, move $v$ from $U$ to $S$.
\end{enumerate}

If $U$ is empty, we pick a vertex $v$ from $T$ and move it to $U$ (select the vertex with the smallest index). If $U\cup T=\emptyset$, query all remaining pairs in $S$ and stop.  

The period of time between two consecutive emptyings of $U$ is called an \textbf{epoch}, which reveals a connected component.  

\begin{proposition}
    The DFS algorithm has the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The number of epochs is equal to the number of connected components.
        \item There are no edges between sets $S$ and $T$ at any time.
        \item The set $U$ always spans a path.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Those directly follow from the algorithm.
\end{proof}

This particular formulation of the DFS algorithm allows for the application on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph, where we query the existence of an edge between two vertices by a Bernoulli trial with probability $p$.  

Denote $X_i\in \{0,1\}$ as the outcome of the $i$-th query, with each $X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$ for $i=1, \ldots, \binom{n}{2}$. 

\begin{proposition}
    Let $S(t), U(t), T(t)$ be the sets at time $t$ in the DFS algorithm. Then, 
    \begin{equation*}
        |U(t)|\leq1+\sum_{i=1}^{t}X_{i} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad |S(t)\cup U(t)|\geq\sum_{i=1}^{t}X_{i}
    \end{equation*}
    At all times, $|S(t)|+|U(t)|+|T(t)|=n$.
\end{proposition}

The $1$ comes from the initial vertex $v$ in $U$ at the beginning of each epoch.
