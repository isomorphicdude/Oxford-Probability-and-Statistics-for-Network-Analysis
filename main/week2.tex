\section{Random Graphs}
In order to judge whether a network summary is ”unusual” or whether a motif (pattern) is ”frequent”, there is an underlying assumption of randomness in the network. The randomness can be intrinsic to the network, and/or may stem from errors in the data. With the random models, we would like to compute important statistics such as \textbf{the degree distribution}, \textbf{the clustering coefficient}, and \textbf{the number of triangles}.

\subsection{Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi}
The first configuration of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs specifies edges with a probability $p$. Namely, for $V=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, the probability of an edge between $i$ and $j$ is $p$ for all $i,j\in V$.
\begin{definition}
    A random graph $G(n,p)$ is a graph on $n$ vertices where the adjacency matrix satisfies
    \begin{equation*}
        \Pr(A_{ij}=1)=p
    \end{equation*}
    The edges are independent of each other.
\end{definition}

In this case, the expected number of edges is $m=\binom{n}{2}p$ and the degree of a vertex $v$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n-1$ and $p$:
$$
\Pr(d(v)=k)=\binom{n-1}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-1-k}
$$

Also, by independence, we can compute the number of triangles by:
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E}[T]&=\sum_{i<j<k} \mathbb{E}[A_{ij}A_{jk}A_{ki}]\\
    &=\binom{n}{3}p^3\\
\end{align*}

Thus, the expected (global) clustering coefficient is
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E}[C]&=\frac{\mathbb{E}[\sum_{u,v,w \in V} a_{uv}a_{vw}a_{wu}]}{\mathbb{E}[\sum_{v\in V} d(v)(d(v)-1)]} \\
    &= \frac{6p^3 \binom{n}{3}}{n ((n-1)p(1-p) + (n-1)^2p^2 -(n-1)p)}\\
    &=p
\end{align*}


An alternative configuration is to specify the number of edges $m$ and choose uniformly from all graphs with $m$ edges. 

\begin{definition}
    A random graph $G(n,m)$ is a graph on $n$ vertices where the adjacency matrix satisfies
    \begin{equation*}
        \Pr(A_{ij}=1)=\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}
    \end{equation*}
    The edges are independent of each other.
\end{definition}

The degree distribution here is hypergeometric:
$$
\Pr(d(v)=k)=\frac{\binom{n-1}{k}\binom{\binom{n}{2}-k}{m-k}}{\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{m}}
$$

where $k=0,1,\ldots,\min(n-1,m)$. To see this, note that we can choose $k$ vertices to be connected to $v$ among $V\setminus \{v\}$, and then choose $m-k$ edges from the remaining $\binom{n}{2}-k$ edges to connect the rest pairs of vertices. 

The expected number of triangles is:
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E}[T]&=\sum_{i<j<k} \mathbb{E}[A_{ij}A_{jk}A_{ki}]\\
    &=\binom{n}{3}\frac{m(m-1)(m-2)}{\binom{n}{2}\left(\binom{n}{2}-1\right)\left(\binom{n}{2}-2\right)}\\
\end{align*}

this is due the dependence between the edges, so for a fixed triplet $(i,j,k)$, we first choose the edge $(i,j)$ with probability $\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}$, then $(j,k)$ with probability $\frac{m-1}{\binom{n}{2}-1}$, and finally $(k,i)$ with probability $\frac{m-2}{\binom{n}{2}-2}$.  

The expected (global) clustering coefficient can be computed similarly, which we omit here.  

\subsection{Small World}

In reality, it is often found that the average distance between two vertices is small, but the clustering coefficient is large. This is known as the \textbf{small world phenomenon}, which cannot be modelled (properly) by the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs.  

\subsubsection{Watts-Strogatz}
The \textbf{Watts-Strogatz model} is a random graph constructed with the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start with a ring of $n$ vertices, where each vertex is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbours on each side (hence $2k$ edges per vertex)
    \item Choose a vertex and rewire each of its edges incident to its clock-wise neighbour with probability $p$.
    \item Repeat the previous process for all vertices (moving in the clock-wise direction).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Watts-Strogatz model (\href{https://www.kth.se}{source})} % should include the precise source
    \label{fig:watts-strogatz}
\end{figure}

When $n>2k$, there are in total $nk$ edges in the network, which remains constant throughout the rewiring process.

\begin{remark}
    Instead of a ring in with $n$ equal spaced vertices $\real^2$, we can also start with a torus in higher dimensions. For example, in $\real^3$, we fold a square lattices of $n^2$ vertices into a torus.
\end{remark}  

One of the most popular modification of Watts-Strogatz is the \textbf{Newman-Moore-Strogatz} model, where instead of rewiring, we introduce random shortcuts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start with a ring of $n$ vertices, where each vertex is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbours.
    \item Add shortcut between $v$ and $u\notin \text{bd}(v)$ with probability $p$.
    \item Repeat for some iterations.
\end{itemize}

This gives an exact degree distribution with $d(v) \sim 2k+\mathrm{Binom}(n-2k-1, p)$.

However, the degree distribution of real world networks often follows a power law, i.e. $p(d)\sim d^{-\gamma}$ for some $\gamma>0$.  

\begin{remark}
    Intuitively, the power-law distribution says that vertices tend to attach to "popular" vertices.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Barab\'{a}si-Albert}  

\begin{definition}
    A probability measure with p.d.f. $p(d)$ is said to follow a \textbf{power law} if there exists $\gamma>0$ and some constant $C>0$ such that $p(d)\sim C d^{-\gamma}$ as $d\to \infty$, where $\gamma$ is called the \textbf{power-law exponent}.
\end{definition}

To explain this power-law behaviour, Albert and Barab\'{a}si proposed the \textbf{preferential attachment model}, which has the following construction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start with $m_0$ vertices, the edges between which are formed arbitrarily.  
    \item (Growth) At each time $t$, add a new vertex with $m\leq m_0$ edges that connect to $m$ existing vertices.
    \item (Preferential attachment) The probability that the new vertex connects to vertex $v_i$ is given by:
    \begin{equation*}
        \pi_i = \frac{d(v_i)}{\sum_j d(v_j)}
    \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

The resulting graph may contain self-loops and multi-edges. A more mathematically rigorous way to define this model is given in \citep{barabasi2016network}.  

\begin{unexaminable}
    To see why the distribution of degrees follows a power law, we consider a continuous-time approximation to the degree of vertex $v_i$, denoted by $k_i(t)$. Then the rate of change is given by:
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{d k_i}{dt} = m \frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j}
    \end{equation*}
    But noting that $\sum_j k_j = 2mt - m$, we can solve this equation  to obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        k_i(t) = m \left( \frac{t}{t_i} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
    \end{equation*}

    where $t_i$ is the time when vertex $v_i$ is added (we used the initial condition $k_i(t_i)=m$).

    To compute the degree distribution, note $\Pr(k_i(t)>k) = \Pr(t_i < \frac{m^2}{k^2} t) = \frac{m^2}{k^2}$, if we assume the vertices were added uniformly over time: $t_i \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,t)$. Now differentiating with respect to $k$, we obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        \Pr(d(v_i)=k) \approx 2m^2 k^{-3}
    \end{equation*}
    for $k$ large. This is a power law with $\gamma=3$.
\end{unexaminable}
